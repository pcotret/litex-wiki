# LiteX Tutorials

## [FPGA 101](https://github.com/litex-hub/fpga_101)
Lessons/Labs given to students to discover FPGAs and learn Migen/LiteX through a hands-on approach.  These tutorials are covering the Migen's basics (syntax/simulations) through common SoC cores: Clock generation, 7-Segments displays, etc... and then the LiteX's basics through the integration of these cores in a SoC. It demonstrates and explains how to control these cores from an Host PC through a bridge (UART) and then directly from a RISC-V Soft-CPU implemented in the FPGA.

These tutorials should help users understand the possibilities of Migen/LiteX and give the basics to create their own Migen cores/LiteX SoCs. 

> **Note:** The labs are based on the Nexys4DDR (now named NexysA7) but can be easily adapted to others boards. Since these tutorials have been written, new less expensive open-source FPGA boards, also compatible with open-source FPGA toolchains, are widely available. The tutorials will probably be adapted to support such boards in the future.
