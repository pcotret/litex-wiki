# LiteX Tutorials

## [FPGA 101](https://github.com/litex-hub/fpga_101)
Lessons/Labs given to students to discover FPGAs and learn Migen/LiteX through a hands-on approach.  These tutorials are covering the Migen's basics (syntax/simulations) through common SoC cores: Clock generation, 7-Segments displays, etc... and then the LiteX's basics through the integration of these cores in a SoC. It demonstrates and explains how to control these cores from an Host PC through a bridge (UART) and then directly from a RISC-V Soft-CPU implemented in the FPGA.

These tutorials should help users understand the possibilities of Migen/LiteX and give the basics to create their own Migen cores/LiteX SoCs.

> **Note:** The labs are based on the Nexys4DDR (now named NexysA7) but can be easily adapted to others boards. Since these tutorials have been written, new less expensive open-source FPGA boards, also compatible with open-source FPGA toolchains, are widely available. The tutorials will probably be adapted to support such boards in the future.

The [Fomu](https://www.crowdsupply.com/sutajio-kosagi/fomu) is a tiny FPGA board that fits in your USB port. The SoC of the FPGA is built with LiteX and the workshop provides a hands-on approach to control the peripherals from a Host PC through the USB bridge from the [ValentyUSB](https://github.com/im-tomu/valentyusb) core and then demonstrates how to create a RISC-V SoC with a [VexRiscv](https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexRiscv) CPU and load/execute/debug C/Rust core with it and control the peripherals of the board.

The Colorlight 5A-75B is an inexpensive (15$) led control board equipped with a Lattice ECP5 FPGA, 2 x 1Gbps Ethernet and lots of IOs. ColorLite project explains how to create a cheap remote control/monitoring system with it can be useful to discover LiteX/LiteEth through a practical example.

The [iCEBreaker](https://www.crowdsupply.com/1bitsquared/icebreaker-fpga) is the first open source iCE40 FPGA development board designed for teachers and students. The iCEBreaker [target](https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards/blob/master/litex_boards/targets/icebreaker.py) integrated in [LiteX-Boards](https://github.com/litex-hub/litex-boards) provides a minimal LiteX SoC for the iCEBreaker with a CPU, its ROM (in SPI Flash), its SRAM, close to the others LiteX targets. A more complete example of LiteX SoC for the iCEBreaker with more features, examples to run C/Rust code on the RISC-V CPU and documentation can be found in the [iCEBreaker LiteX examples](https://github.com/icebreaker-fpga/icebreaker-litex-examples) tutorial.
