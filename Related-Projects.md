## [Fomu](https://fomu.im) - A tiny FPGA board which fits in your USB port

Fomu is a very small FPGA board which is well supported by the LiteX ecosystem and has a [workshop](https://workshop.fomu.im) which includes LiteX demos.

## [F4PGA - Fully open source RTL to bitstream flow](https://f4pga.org)

[F4PGA is a fully open source toolchain for the development of FPGAs of multiple vendors](https://f4pga.org). Currently, it targets the Xilinx 7-Series, Lattice iCE40, Lattice ECP5 FPGAs, QuickLogic EOS S3 and is gradually being expanded to provide a comprehensive end-to-end FPGA synthesis flow.

Support for the F4PGA tool flow is included in the LiteX ecosystem and LiteX designs are used as benchmarks for the tooling.

## [CFU Playground](https://cfu-playground.rtfd.io)

“CFU” stands for Custom Function Unit: accelerator hardware that is tightly coupled into the pipeline of a CPU core, to add new custom function instructions that complement the CPU’s standard functions (such as arithmetic/logic operations).
